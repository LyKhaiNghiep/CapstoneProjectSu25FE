# CapstoneProjectSu25FE
# Context
-	Currently, FPT University HCMC has a very large number of trash bins located on different floors and areas, which makes it difficult to determine when the trash bins are full. In addition, assigning workers to clean the trash manually leads to information that is very easy to make mistakes and makes it difficult to keep track of attendance.
-	To overcome these disadvantages, the MSWT system was born. Smart trash management system using IoT (Internet of Things) devices is a modern technological solution to optimize the process of garbage collection and trash management. The functions of this system often include:
•	Bin Fullness Monitoring

•	Automatic Notification Sending

•	Remote Control and Communication System

•	Work scheduling and worker attendance

# Proposed Solutions
●	MSWT is the proposed system to solve the above problems for user groups:
FPT University HCMC struggles with inefficient trash management due to manual bin checks and unstructured cleaning staff coordination. This project offers a Smart Trash Bin and Cleaning Staff Management System that combines bin monitoring with staff scheduling, improving efficiency. It will help lessen the problems which occur when trash bins are full and improve the campus scenery.
